AI Privacy Guard Pro — Why This Stands Out
==========================================

Executive Summary
-----------------
AI Privacy Guard Pro is not a “domain blocker” or a simple warning banner. It is an
enterprise-grade, privacy-first AI governance layer that runs in the browser:
• Guides employees toward safer AI usage in real time (not after-the-fact policy docs)
• Gives security leaders visibility and evidence (metadata-only) without harvesting content
• Bridges the gap between policy and behaviour with adaptive risk, policy profiles, PIN overrides,
  and a friction-minimising UX to keep productivity high


Top 10 Differentiators
-----------------------------------------------
1) Two-Layer Detection
   • Layer 1: Domain detection (e.g., chatgpt.com, claude.ai) with suffix-aware matching
   • Layer 2: In‑app AI usage detection across regular sites (Gmail/Docs/Slack/etc.)
     via safe heuristic signals (UI elements, AI buttons, prompt areas) - without reading content

2) Risk Scoring Engine (Configurable, Additive, Capped)
   • Combines: AI domain, in‑app AI presence, internal site hints, and sensitive-field hints
   • Per-profile thresholds (Strict/Confirm/Allow) and tunable weights to reflect policy
   • Feels like a real DLP/CASB “policy brain” instead of binary blocking

3) Policy Profiles Built In
   • Strict: PIN-gated high risk + blocking shield on cancel
   • Confirm: Light-touch, warn + proceed (keeps work flowing)
   • Allow: Silent by default (no prompts) except for Blocklist policy sites

4) Admin PIN Override Where It Matters
   • For high-risk actions in Strict, users must enter a PIN (local policy, no server dependency)
   • “Cancel” in high-risk shows a blocking overlay (no silent bypass)

5) Consent Window + Cooldown (No Prompt Fatigue)
   • Once approved, user won’t be nagged on that tab+host for a set window (e.g., 10 minutes)
   • Deduplication gates, per-tab consent, and router suppression protect UX

6) Redirect to Approved AI (Guidance > Blocking)
   • One-click “Use Approved AI” routes users to an organisation-approved tool
   • Admin-configured URL (e.g., internal RAG portal, Copilot, Claude, etc.)
   • Motivates the safe path rather than dead-end blocks

7) Privacy by Design (Default)
   • Tracking OFF by default
   • If enabled: “Anonymized” only logs SHA-256 prompt hashes or basic metadata
   • Nothing leaves the device unless an admin explicitly exports logs

8) Audit-Ready Evidence (Metadata Only)
   • Local logs: timestamp, domain, detection type (domain/UI), router opened, decision
     (proceed/cancel/redirect), role, anonymous user ID — NO content captured by default
   • One-click export (JSON) for GRC/CISO review

9) Suffix-Aware Allowlist/Blocklist per Profile
   • Lists are bound to the active profile (real enterprise nuance)
   • “Allow” silences prompts, “Blocklist” elevates risk to 100 across paths (domain+UI)

10) Production-Grade Stability in Modern Web Apps
   • Works across iframes / about:blank/srcdoc frames (all_frames + match_about_blank)
   • Safe messaging guards: never crash if extension APIs are unavailable in a subframe
   • “Immediate reprompt” on policy switch — re-evaluates open tabs on the spot

Core Features (At a Glance)
---------------------------
• Domain & in‑app AI usage detection (no content reading)
• Risk scoring with configurable weights & thresholds
• Profiles: Strict / Confirm / Allow (with per-profile allow/block lists)
• Admin PIN & blocking shield for high-risk interactions
• Consent window & cooldown to prevent repeat prompts
• “Use Approved AI” redirect button (configurable URL)
• Local-only logs; optional anonymized/full modes (still local)
• AI Directory (curated list + custom additions)
• Options UI for admins: policy, roles, lists, logs, directory
• Accessibility-conscious overlay: keyboard and ARIA-friendly

Why This Is “Enterprise” (Not Just Another Extension)
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Real policy expression: Profiles, thresholds, lists, PINs, redirects
2) Evidence generation for GRC: metadata-only, exportable, explainable
3) Least-privilege privacy model: default OFF telemetry; anonymized pathways
4) Measurable UX quality: consent windows, deduplication, calming heuristics
5) Extensibility & maintainability: tunable scores, curated directory, per-profile lists

Security & Privacy Guarantees
-----------------------------
• No server calls, no third-party tracking — storage is local to the browser
• Default behavior does not capture prompts or keystrokes
• If admins enable anonymized tracking: prompt text → SHA-256 hash only
• Admin PIN stored locally; no centralised secrets required for demo
• “Blocklist -> risk=100” applies consistently in both domain and UI paths

Architecture at a Glance
------------------------
• Manifest V3 (service worker)
  - background.js: policy brain (detection, scoring, routing, logging, consent)
  - content.js: page observer, UI renderer, safe-message guarded
  - utils.js: risk, storage wrappers, hashing, user ID, logging
• Options UI: profile editing, lists, logs, directory, approved-URL, role
• AI Directory: curated domains + custom entries
• Robust injection: all_frames + match_about_blank; early runtime checks for complex SPAs

How We Bridge Policy → Behaviour (The “Why It Works”)
-----------------------------------------------------
• Detect: Domain & in-app signals raise contextual awareness
• Decide: Score risk from multiple factors; map to profile policies
• Guide: Warn, require PIN, or redirect to approved AI
• Respect: Avoid spam via consent windows; keep people working
• Prove: Exportable metadata logs create accountability and visibility

Measurable Outcomes
-------------------------------------------
• Reduced unsafe AI usage without blunt-force blocking
• Clear evidence trail: who (role), where (domain), what (type), when (timestamp), action (decision)
• Faster adoption of approved AI (redirect button)
• Fewer false positives / fewer prompts (consent & cooldown)
• Policy agility (change profile → immediate reprompt)

Roadmap
---------------------------------
• Central policy sync (optional enterprise console)
• Role-based default profiles and allowlists from directory services
• Prebuilt rule packs (Finance/Legal/HR) for instant deployment
• More heuristic packs for in‑app AI (new selectors, model‑agnostic)
